# Monopole Antenna and Skin (3D FDTD)

* This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of the 3D Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method for simulating the interaction between a monopole antenna and skin. The FDTD method is a powerful numerical technique for solving Maxwell's equations in the time domain, widely used in computational electromagnetics to study wave interactions with biological tissues.

## Features
* 3D FDTD Simulation: Implements a full three-dimensional FDTD algorithm to model the electromagnetic field generated by a monopole antenna and its interaction with a skin-like medium.
* Monopole Antenna Modeling: Accurately represents the electromagnetic characteristics of a monopole antenna.
* Skin Medium Modeling: Simulates the electromagnetic properties of skin, including conductivity, permittivity, and permeability.
* User-Friendly MATLAB Code: Provides clear, well-documented MATLAB scripts that are easy to understand and modify.
* Visualization Tools: Includes functions to visualize electric and magnetic field distributions over time, allowing for detailed analysis of wave behavior in the skin medium.
* Customizable Parameters: Allows users to adjust simulation parameters such as grid size, time steps, antenna properties, and skin properties.
